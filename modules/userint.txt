The viewport settings and origin are always in screen coordinates. Any UI
drawing functions are in viewport coordinates, ie 0, 0 is the top left of
the current viewport. The ui_create_window sets up the viewport and moves
the ui_origin to the top left automatically. It creates a window 1 pixels
thinner than requested because it draws a border around the area first. 
The ui_origin may be moved to any position in or outside of the viewport.
The display_text function will display text in the currently initialised 
font, returning the exact length in pixels of the text drawn. Unknown 
characters are ignored. The ui_clip function takes pointers to four values,
top left and bottom right, and clips to the current viewport. The values
are modified to the clipped values.
