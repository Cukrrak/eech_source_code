RGB files are the raw data format used for memory mapped files.
Basically the format is the first 2 short ints contain the x_size and
the y_size of the image, and the rest of the file is the raw data. stored
as screen_values. These maybe mapped directly into the video memory, hence 
the name!

sample code - just copies the rgb file to the screen :-

        unsigned short int
                *screen_ptr,
                *image,
                x_size,
                y_size;

   image = (unsigned short int *) mopen ("picture.rgb");

   x_size = *image;

   image ++;

   y_size = *image;

   image ++;

   screen_ptr = (unsigned short int *) get_screen_data (active_screen);

   memcpy (screen_ptr, image, x_size * y_size * sizeof (short int));
