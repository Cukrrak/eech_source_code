      <h2>What's NEW in EECH 1.9?</h2>
      <p><em>(since version 1.8.6)</em></p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Weapons modelling
      <dd>
          <ul>
	     <li>Gun projectiles and unguided rockets are now affected
	           by gravity, drag and dispersion.  As a result
		   rounds take longer to reach their target and with
		   less accuracy.
	     <li>Vikhr missiles now follow a spiral flight path
	     <li>Vikhr launch racks will depress up to 12 degrees to
	     align with target direction.  This helps as the Vikhr now
	     has very narrow launch restrictions for weapon launch.
	     <li>Rockets and missiles will now only create smoke for
	     as long as the rocket engine is burning.
	     <li>Rockets adjusted to have shorter burn time and faster
	     acceleration.
	     <li>Muzzle velocity adjusted for many weapons to better
	     match real world values.
	     <li>New values for GWUT file for changing weapons drag,
	     spiral path and seeker limits.  These are included in
	     gwut190.csv, but note that the GWUT editor (version 1.3)
	     is not yet capable of editing these values, and will delete them
	     from any file which contains them.  So you will have to edit the
	     file with a text editor until a new version of the GWUT editor
	     comes out
	  </ul>
      <dt>Avionics changes
      <dd>
          <ul>
	    <li>New weapons aiming avionics for ballistic weapons. See
	    <a
	          href="http://www.eechcentral.com/wiki/index.php?title=Firing_guns_and_rockets">
		  wiki article</a> for details.
            <li>New flight MFD page, revised TADS page and added
	    colour to many other MFD pages for Comanche.
	    <li>New HUD for Comanche
	    <li>New flight, TSD, radar and engine pages for Alligator.  Added
	    colour to several other pages.
            <li>DTV/LLLTV will now show a full-colour(for
	    Comanche) or monochrome (for the others) TV view, not a IR-view.
	    <li>DTV/LLLTV in Comanche and Ka-52 is now capable changing zoom
	    level.
	    <li>EO zoom level can now be changed even if EO is not
	    active targeting system.  Use CTRL + keypad +/- for this.
	    <li>EO camera can now be changed even if EO is not active
	    targeting system.  Use Shift + END for this.
          </ul>

      <dt>Campaign map changes
      <dd>      
          <ul>
	    <li>New relief shaded topographical campaign map
	    <li>Hi-res campaign map and alternative map palette also
	          available (campaign_map_mode and campaign_map_palette in
		  eech.ini)
            <li>Adjustable how often enemy units update.  By default
	          the position of known enemy units are updated once every 2
		  minutes.  Configurable by map_update_interval in eech.ini.
            <li>Fixed bug where undiscovered enemy units would show up
	          if you just zoomed the map enough.
            <li>Campaign map in free flight mode now allows adding and
	          moving waypoints.
	  </ul>
      <dt>External cameras
      <dd>
          <ul>
            <li>New free camera mode.  Press F9 when
	    already in chase or weapons camera view.  Use mouse to
	    pan, arrow keys or mouse wheel to move camera.
	    <li>New wobbly camera option (wobbly-camera in eech.ini)
	    for chase and weapons camera.  Gives the impression of the camera
	    being mounted in a chase plane/helicopter which is not always
	    able to keep perfect view of object.
	    <li>Chase camera allows a limited amount of movement from
	    object being chased.  Use arrow keys for this.
	  </ul>
      <dt>Smoke fixes
      <dd>
          <ul>
	    <li>You can now disable the persistent smoke
	    (persistent_smoke=0 in eech.ini).  With it enabled smoke 
	    will only be created for about 10 seconds, instead of minutes.
	     <li>Rockets and missiles only generate smoke as long as
	     the rocket engine is burning.
	    <li>Slightly adjusted smoke colour.
	    <li>Fixed a crash which would sometimes happen with smoke.
	  </ul>
      <dt>Other changes
      <dd>
         <ul>
	    <li>Fixed a problem for multiplayer/saved games where
	    data would get corrupted
	    <li>Trim does no longer affect helicopter attitude in
	    hover hold mode.
	    <li>... and probably some more changes I've forgotten to
	    mention, and numerous bugs I haven't discovered yet :)
	 <ul>
      </dl>

      <h2><a name="installation"></a>Installation and addons</h2>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>NEW</strong>: Go to www.eechcentral.com and download
      the installation tool: <A
      href="http://www.planet.nl/~ek000114/gotcha/download/eechupdater1.3.exe">eechupdater1.3.exe</A></p>
      <p>This will download and install all patches and addon packs
      that you need. If new packs arrive this tool will detect them
      and download them, keeping your database up to date. It is still
      a good idea to read the following! </p>
      <hr>

      <h3 class="p">Basic Install </h3>
      <p class="p">If you do not own EE - Apache Havoc you can skip the first two steps </p>
      <ol>
        <li><span lang=EN-GB>Install EE - Apache Havoc from CD and run once to unpack the graphics files. </span></li>
        <li><span lang=EN-GB>Patch EEAH up to <a href="http://www.razorworks.com/enemyengaged/mainframe.html#Patches" target="_blank">patch 1.1E</a>, run once. </span></li>
        <li>Install EE - Comanche Hokum from the CD. </li>
        <li><strong>Do not forget this: </strong>Download and install <a href="http://www.razorworks.com/enemyengaged/chpatch/EECH_Patch.exe">patch 141C</a> from the Razorworks site: documentation is <a href="http://www.razorworks.com/enemyengaged/chpatch/index.html" target="_blank">here</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>If there are new options the old <strong>eech.ini</strong> will still be read and the new options added when you leave the game. Start the game once and leave it to see which options are added. </p>
      <p>IMPORTANT: when you have just installed eech by default the
      <strong>avionics</strong> <strong>in the options menu </strong>
      is set at <strong>&quot;novice&quot;. This means that you cannot
      operate the targetting systems,</strong> it is done for you in
      the game by the &quot;copilot&quot;. Set this option at
      <strong>advanced</strong> when in the game for full operation.
      When you delete the game.cfg and it is recreated by the game,
      the option is reset at novice! </p>

      <h3>Addons</h3>
      <p>These addons should all be installed directly in your Razorworks directory. Normally the setup files recognize the correct directory and create and install all that is needed, you only have to click yes. The order below gives you the best result ;-). </p>
      <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: to use modded textures you have to set the following options in <strong>eech.ini</strong>: <br>
&quot;texture_colour=1&quot;, &quot;mipmapping=1&quot;, &quot;texture_filtering=1&quot; and &quot;dynamic_water=1&quot;. Also set the anisotropy setting of your graphics card to a higher quality setting. </p>
      <p>The following texture packs can be installed in random order (note that these packs create a load of extra directories under /razorworks/cohokum/graphics/textures):</p>

      <h2><a name="trouble"></a>Trouble shooting </h2>
      <p>If your game doesn't run properly, there is not so much that can be done! </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have some weird behaviour, go to the directory razorworks\cohokum and delete the files <em><strong>game.cfg</strong></em> which contains all the settings of the in-game user interface, and <em><strong>eech.ini</strong></em> which contains additional and settings for mods, in the cohokum directory. These files are regenerated automatically. <strong>NOTE: </strong>when you delete <strong><em>game.cfg</em></strong> the avionics in the options screen is reset to &quot;novice&quot; and the targeting systems do not work, you have to set it to &quot;advanced&quot; to make it work again.<br>
        </li>
        <li>A fresh install has been known to help in many cases (but its a pain).<br>
        </li>
        <li>Set the screen refresh to &quot;always on&quot; for Radeon cards.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Try in the <em>options</em> screen to set the <em>Device</em> selection to either automatic or Primary Display Driver. This may sometimes help.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Graphics settings in eech.ini: try changing the <em>notnl </em>setting <br>
        </li>
        <li>Some people reported a problem with NVIDIA drivers 71.xx, no cure yet. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Very old saved games may not work because certain modded settings will not be in the game. This is rare however.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Framerates: these cannot be improved much because of the old rendering system. Framerate killers are FLIR especially above cities. Also in the eech.ini settings, the options &quot;highresMFD&quot;, &quot; high_lod_hack&quot; and &quot;cbar&quot; should be set to off or a low value. Set mfr to a high value (999). Note that the best way to test framerates is with the tool &quot;FRAPS&quot;. 
  Of course on your graphics card AA settings may have a negative effect (but not always, this is not the bottleneck), and the &quot;texture preference&quot; can be set to &quot;high performance&quot; instead of &quot;high quality&quot;. <br>
        </li>
        <li>If you have windows XP and can't run apache havoc try running it in win 98 mode: right click on the executable and its a setting in properties -&gt; compatibility.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Please try to repeat the error and report about it on the <a href="http://www.simhq.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum&f=30" target="_blank">SimHQ - EECH forum. </a>There is a file <em><strong>error.log</strong> </em>in your cohokum directory when the game crashes but it is a memory stack dump and pretty useless, no need to report that. </li>
      </ul>      <p align="right"><span
lang=EN-GB><a href="#top">[top ^]</a></span>
      </p>
      <h2><span class="style37" lang=EN-GB><a name="gameinfo"></a>Game info </span></h2>
      <p>There are a number of ways to play this game:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>As is, default settings, default graphics. Great game.</li>
        <li>Download the <em>superpatch2</em> with tons of custom made warzones/campaigns/skirmishes</li>
        <li>Use a <a href="#wut">WUT</a> file to change the behaviour of vehicles and aircraft all in the game , increased difficulty (some say more realistic).</li>
        <li>Use custom textures to improve the looks of the game.</li>
        <li>Browse through the <a href="#eechini">eech.ini</a> and activate for instance &quot;faa=1&quot; (fly any aircraft, jump in returning choppers and have a field day) or for instance &quot;camcom=1&quot;, the campaign commander which lets you create missions and give you a greater control of the campaign. </li>
        <li>Play online with MP (look <a href="http://hoxdna.org/eech/" target="_blank">on this server</a> to see what's up). </li>
      </ol>      
      <h3><span class="style37" lang=EN-GB>Flyable choppers</span></h3>
      <p><span lang=EN-GB>As of version 1.6.0.W12 you can fly, change the loadout and repair the following choppers: Comanche, Apache Longbow, HokumB, Havoc, Blackhawk, Hind, AH64-A (Apache), and KA50 (Hokum). The cockpits and the flight behaviour of the new blue choppers default to the Apache Longbow, of the red choppers to the Havok. </span></p>
      <p><span lang=EN-GB>Note that you can pick a returning chopper to fly rogue. Spot the wanted Helo in the 2D-map, click on it, accept, auto-select (mission), confirm and off you go (you can't choose it from the mission or group list since it has no task). You can only do this if the option &quot;faa&quot; in eech.ini is set to &quot;1&quot; (see <a href="#eechini">eech.ini</a>). </span></p>
      <p>Jabberwock made any chopper flyable in free-flight mode. Just
      be sure you activate the &quot;fly any aircraft&quot; switch in

      <p>Seems to be fairly smooth these days, <span lang=EN-GB></span><span lang=EN-GB>but the test environment is limited, so there could still be bugs left. <span class="MsoNormal"><b>It's crucial that the host runs with cvc=1</b></span>.

      <h3><a name=wut></a><span class="style37" lang=EN-GB>What is a WUT file?</span></h3>
      <p><span lang=EN-GB>Most people fly with a WUT file. A WUT-profile (Weapons and Units Tweaker file) is a text file that alters some critical parameters in the game to make it more &quot;realistic&quot; and harder. The text file name can be added to the file <a href="#eechini">eech.ini </a>and all parameters are read by cohokum.exe at startup. The most used WUT file is <strong>gwut151D.csv</strong> which basically increases speed and scan capabilities of aircraft and vehicles and power of various weapons (increasing gameplay difficulty). Furthermore there is <strong>gwut1613H.csv</strong> which adds enemy chopper aggressiveness (all enemy choppers behave as if they are on a strike mission), and <span><strong>gwut146X.csv </strong>which is needed when playing multiplayer and has the game's default values (identical to playing without a WUT file). </span></span>A last GWUT files has bee added: <strong>gwut162B.csv</strong> by KLiM, see <a href="http://www.simhq.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=30;t=004561" target="_blank">here</a> for a description. </p>
      <p><span lang=EN-GB><span>You can edit these files with the GWUT editor, downloadable from </span></span><a
href="http://home.planet.nl/%7Ejette073/gotcha"><span lang=EN-GB>Gotcha's site</span></a>. <span lang=EN-GB>If you intend to join a MP-game all three WUT files are needed. You are not aware of the host's profile until you're connecting and if the host is running with one of the WUT profiles your game will look for a similar one in your cohokum-folder. </span></p>

          <td class="Normal"><p>This mod adds a color and/or shaded
        relief map background to the TSD of the Comanche, Hokum and
        Apache (the Havoc is not included). Ctrl-D cycles through the
        options. There are 3 palettes to choose from for the elevation
        (Alt-D). The Apache has the same TSD
        as the Comanche.The configuration is
        automatically saved in the eech.ini file when you leave the
        game. <br> 
          Optional: the friendlies and enemies are shown in red and
        blue colours (including detection circles of SAMs). If you
        don't want this option set the eech.ini variable
        &quot;tsdenemy&quot; to 0. There is
        may be a framerate hit when showing the terrain.
	If tsddetail is set to 1 the TSD map will always use high
        detail level map, even if in 25KM range mode (might cause
        lower frame rate).

      <h3><a name="history"></a>Version history</h3>
      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.8.6:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix for save games and multiplayer crashing in 1.8.5.
	<li>Export also the upfront display/ekran data to shared
	memory (fix by Retro).
      </ul>


      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.8.5:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Added arrow keys as fine adjustment of trim.  Useful in
	when helicopter is mostly trimmed, but just
        need some fine adjustment. Only works when using a joystick
	for cyclic control.
	<li>Added shared memory export of flight data (thanks to
	Retro)
	<li>Added waypoint, weapon and NG RPM data to shared memory
	export.
	<li>Several crash fixes including when taking damage in
	Cobra and other helicopters with general modelling (thanks to
	Richard Evans for all the crash fixes).
      </ul>

      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.8.4:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed Hind's flight model which caused it to be suddently
	do violent manouvers and crash.
	<li>Reverted fix which caused some missiles to continue
	unguided when they lost guidance.  They will now self destruct
	again.  The unguided fix caused crashes in multiplayer.
	<li>Fixed so that mouse buttons can be used with the EO
	cameras again.
	<li>If the registry doesn't contain a Apache Havoc entry, EECH
	will now check if the aphavoc directory exists in the same
	directory as cohokum, and use it if it does (only used for Apache
	and Havoc cockpit textures).
      </ul>

      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.8.3:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug where save games would come up as invalid even
	if saved with same version.
	<li>Reverted Gotcha's camo fix as it caused more problems than
	it solved.
      </ul>

      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.8.2:</h4>
     <ul>
        <li>Several changes to guided missile flight model
	  <ul>
	    <li>Missiles might now lose guidance if target moves
	    outside seeker's limit. Air-to-air missile will self
	    destruct if this happens, air-to-ground missiles will
	    continue on unguided.
	    <li>Hellfires launched in LOBL mode should now be able to
	    hit targets at close and medium ranges again :)
	    <li>Hellfires launched in LOAL mode now always does the
	    initial climb and hence won't be able to hit targets at
	    close range (closer than 2km).
	    <li>Seeker field of view reduced for the Russian Anti-tank
	    missiles (Ataka, Vikhr, Spiral). Used to be around 25
	    degrees from center, now is 10-15 degrees (if using the new
	    gwut file).
	    <li>Anti tank missiles and other missiles with shaped
	    charges will do less collateral damage now, as most of the
	    blast is concentrated on the target hit directly.
	    <li>Air-to-ground missiles which lose their lock will
	    not self destruct but continue on (until hitting the
	    ground, getting too slow, or if a semi-active missile
	    until it has a new target inside seeker limits).
	  </ul>
	<li>Several Additions to the pilot log
	  <ul>
	    <li>New option to restore log to what it was before last
	    mission (i.e. erase last mission). Useful if e.g. the game
	    bugs causing you do die. Only works if you do it right
	    after the mission, if you exit EECH you won't be able
	    to erase the mission the next time you start.
	    <li>New page with flying hours and number of missions for
	    each helicopter type.
	    <li>More detailed statistics on which types of targets
	    have been destroyed by the pilot.
	    <li>New statistic for number of helicopters lost. This is
	    the number of helicopters crashed, or landed outside of a
	    base. For converted logs this will start with the same
	    number as KIA.
	    <li>KIA value will now be increased if you die also before
	    the mission is completed.
	    <li>A mission in which you crash is now counted as a
	    mission flown, even if mission was not over at the time of
	    the crash. You will however not get any points (used for
	    calculating promotions and medals).
	    <li>As a result of these changes this version uses a new
	    format for the pilot log, and a new file (player2.bin).
	    Old logs will be converted to the new format on first
	    start of 1.8.2.  But the unknown values (the ones which
	    were not stored previously) will be 0, except for
	    helicopter kills which gets set to the number of air kills
	    the old log had (even though some of those kills might
	    have been fixed wing aircraft).
	    <li>Fixed bug where some missions were logged twice (and
	    not necessarily with the same result).
	  </ul>
	<li>MFD changes
	   <ul>
	   	<li>When using manual startup, the helicopter will now start
		with HUD system and MFDs powered down (except for the
		co-pilot's, he has already activated his own). Use Ctrl-K to
		active HUD, and Ctrl-[ and ] to active the MFDs.
		<li>ALT [ and ] will now not only activate and
		deactive the Comanches side MFDs, but also cycle their
		mode.
		<li>Apache's TADS and radar MFD pages now has time
		until impact for hellfires in the high action display
		area. And in TADS a flashing L has been added below
		and to the right of the target gates when the laser is
		active.
		<li>Fixed overlaid MFDs being too dark with night vision in
		pilot view without cockpit.
		<li>Fixed some of the Longbow's new MFD modes which didn't
		work in overlaid mode.
		<li>Fixed TSD's mouse pointer which didn't work in
		overlaid mode.
		<li>Increased size of overlaid MFDs a little for Longbow and
		Havoc, to make them easier to read.
		<li>Overlaid MFDs now always use big size, no matter
		what HUD size you're using.
		<li>New eech option (targeting_system_auto_page) to control if
		changing targeting system will also automaticly switch to the
		targeting system's MFD page.
	   </ul>
	<li>Other changes
	  <ul>
	<li>Implemented non-linear axis for cyclic, collective and
	pedals. Cyclic and pedals are less sensitive around centre,
	making fine adjustments easier. Collective can be adjusted to
	have bigger range around 60-100%, where most of the time is
	spent. Makes hovering easier with better control and finer
	adjustments.
	<li>The laser will deactivate when target moves outside of
	TADS's field of view (or similar targeting system). It will
	also lose lock on target if target or lasing helicopter makes
	too violent manouvers for the targeting system to follow.
	The laser will most likely also disengage when switching
	targets in manual laser mode.
	<li>AI wingmen won't any longer need to climb to get line of
	sight to target when firing radar guided hellfires. They will
	instead use LOAL mode and fire from behind cover.
	<li>AI will no longer waste guided air-to-surface missiles.
	They will not refire a guided missile at the same target until
	the first missile has missed (or hit but failed to destroy
	target). Not just fire a new missile every few seconds even if
	they have several missiles heading for the target already.
        <li>Fixed crash with A-model Apache, and all other helicopters
	using its cockpit.
	<li>Fixed bug which caused trying to throttle engine down
	before it was started to actually start the engine.
	<li>There was a conflict of keys in last build. Both deselect
	PFZ and deactivate targeting system was on CTRL NUMPAD DEL. So
	now things have moved a little.  Deactive targeting system has
	moved to SHIFT-DEL (normal DEL).  Should hopefully be a little
	more logical to keep all select targeting system commands in
	that keygroup.  And now all the PFZ commands are at
	NUMPAD DEL. ALT deselects current PFZ, and CTRL delets it (and
	SHIFT and plain cycle PFZs like it used to do).
	<li>Changed "use master server" eech.ini option to default to
	off. That way you won't be broadscasting your IP (and other
	info) just by enabeling multiplayer.
	<li>Fixed bug with desert camo (gotcha)
	</ul>
      </ul>


      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.8.1:</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>Longbow's threat warning MFD page (ASE) has got
	colours.  SAM sites have RED rings, AAA yellow.  IR missiles
	are red, radar missiles are yellow, and laser guided missiles
	are blue.
	<li>Longbow's ASE has threat identification. Below the threat
	symbol is a number identifying the type (19 for a SA-19, 29
	for a MiG-29 etc.  The only non obvious id is N which stands
	for naval, i.e. the air defence system of a ship).
	<li>Changed side selection screen for free flight to select
	specific helicopter type.  It's not perfect yet, if the
	helicopter is not available in the selected campaign it will
	crash (although all helicopters are available in most
	campaigns). Also the 3D model for the other helicopters are a
	little weird with too many subobjects.
        <li>Fixed crash bug in Comanche when using manual laser
	<li>Fixed background colour in some Longbow MFD pages
	appearing too bright at dusk and dawn
	<li>Fixed mixup of greenmfd and colourmfd in eech.ini
	<li>Fixed position of hellfire time of flight for US HUDs
	<li>Fixed that Longbow weapons MFD page would list laser as
	range finding system even when laser was off. It now displays
	TRNGL (for triangulation) when laser is off.
      </ul>

      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.8.0:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Avionics changes
        <ol>
        <li>Added option for manual laser and radar control. With it
      enabled you will have to activate and deactivate the laser and
      radar manually (keypad * and / keys respectively. Switching
      radar to single sweep mode has been moved to SHIFT + keypad /).
      In non-radar targeting modes the laser needs to 
      be active to get accurate range to target, and must be active to
      fire laser guided missiles.
      Radar activates automatically when switching to a radar targeting
      mode with the option off. With it on you can activate/deactivate
      the radar at any time regardless of which targeting mode is
      active.
        <li>Removed radar as targeting system from all helicopters
	except AH-64D, RAH-66, Mi-28N and Ka-52.
	<li>Removed TADS as targeting system from Blackhawk.
        <li>Added new MFD page for Apache: flight, which displays
	some of the same information as the IHADSS.
	<li>Added different underlays for the Apache TSD page;  None,
      map and TADS imagery. Switch between the three with SHIFT+D.
        <li>Added Priority Fire Zones (PFZs) and No Fire Zones (NFZs)
	to Apache TSD. See <a href="http://www.eechcentral.com/index.php?pagename=Apache%20Longbow%20TSD">documentation</a>
	<li>Added zoom capability to the Longbow's radar.  Press
	SHIFT-KEYPAD- to zoom in on selected target, SHIFT-KEYPAD+ to
        zoom out to full view again.  In zoomed view the radar view
        shows targets in a 500x500 meter area around the selected target.
	<li>Updated Apache TADS and radar pages to show more information
        <li>Added colours for some of the Apache Longbow MFD pages
        (TSD, flight page)
	<li>Longbow's cockpit has gotten full head position movement.
	<li>Disabled low-res mode for the MFDs as there is
        practically no frame rate difference, and no GFX cards out
	today which don't support 256x256 textures.
	<li>Added option for selecting detail level of TSD map -
        tsddetail in eech.ini (gotcha).
      </ol>

      <li>Weapons changes
      <ol> 
        <li>Changed Hellfire flight profiles.  LOBL Hellfires now
      follow a slightly high trajectory (instead of going straigt for
      target), LOAL Hellfires follow a high trajectory.
        <li>If you have a target selected already when firing in LOAL
      mode the Hellfire will go for that target, even if you switch
      target before it finishes its climb. This makes riple firing
      Hellfires in LOAL much easier (particulary in combination with
      PFZs).
        <li>Laser must be active for laser guided missiles (K
      Hellfires and Vikhrs) to guide. Laser is acticated automatically
      unless the manual laser option is enabled in eech.ini.
      </ol>

      <li>Night changes
      <ol>
        <li>Added eech.ini option for adjusting night level brightness
      (thanks to gotcha).
        <li>Changes colour of russian night vision from amber to a
      blueish-green colour.
        <li>Added optional shading of screen edges (restricted_nvg_fov
      in eech.ini) with night vision active for a more realistic
      restricted field of view.
      </ol>

      <li>Other changes
      <ol>
        <li>Added eech.ini option for showing force vector on own
      helicopter. This is mostly for debugging the flight model, or if
      you're just curious which forces are acting on the helicopter.
        <li>Added new radio message to flight which requests status.
      Wingmen will reply with how many weapons and how much damage
      they have.
        <li>Added new radio command for transfering PFZ with targets
      to wingman and ordering him to attack all targets in it.
        <li>Allow each campaign/skirmish to have its own formscomp.dat
      file. Will use file in common/maps/mapx or
      common/maps/mapx/campaignname if they exist. This allows each
      campaign/skirmish to have its own force composition.
        <li>Increased default initial multiplayer buffer sizes for
      hopefully less connection problems in multiplayer (sugggested
      by Kimchoc1).
      </ol>
      
      <li>Bug fixes
      <ol>
        <li>Fixed the head-on-a-stick movement of the head in
      wideview.
        <li>Fixed a bug in the Hokum and Havoc flight model where it would
      suddenly start doing violent yaw movements, and eventuelly go
      out of control.
        <li>Fixed bug where UI would sometimes freeze in session
      screen if multiplayer master server was down.
        <li>Fixed crash bug in Hokum's HUD view.
	<li>Changed displayed name of Hind from Mi-24D to Mi-24V, as
      the model simulated in EECH is clearly not a D, and appears to
      be a V.
	</ol>
      </ul>

      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.7.2:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>New high-resolution HUD for the Mi-28 (similar to new Ka-52 HUD)
	<li>Track-IR and G-forces can now move head position also in Mi-28
	<li>Added heading tape to TSD for Comanche and Hokum
	<li>Further tweaking to low and medium speed flight dynamics.
	<li>Fixed bug with head pitch not being saved in wideview
	<li>Fixed bug with g-force_head_movement modifier in eech.ini not working properly.
	<li>Fixed bug with new Hokum HUD appearing only as a filled block in external view and internal view without cockpit.
	<li>Fixed bug with tail rotor not being powerful enough to
      counteract torque with cross coupling disabled.
      </ul>

      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.7.1:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed version number used for checking multiplayer compatability
      </ul>
      

      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.7:</h4>

      <dl>
      <dt>Flight model changes</dt>
      <dd><ol>
	<li>Numerous changes to make autorotation work (read <a
	href="http://www.copters.com/pilot/autorotation.html">here</a>
	to learn how to autorotate). 
	  <ul>
	    <li>Rotor brake is now actually engaging/disenging rotor
	    to engine, it's not a brake</li>
	    <li>The collective now works also when the rotor is disengaged</li>
	    <li>Landing with engine failures don't automaticly make
	    the helicopter explode</li>
	    <li>Created new aerodynamic model for rotor RPM when rotor
	    is disengaged. Rotor RPM is now affect by autorotation
	    which increases rotor RPM, and induced and profile drag
	    which reduces rotor RPM.</li>
	    <li>Rotor makes no torque when rotor is disengaged</li>
	    <li>When the rotor is disengaged, the main rotor drives
	    the tail rotor so that it doesn't stop.</li>
	    <li>When the rotor is disengaged rotor rpm may exceed
	    100%, but get it too high and the rotor might fail as well. Add
	    collective to slow the rotor down again.</li>
	    <li>Rotor automatically disengages if both engines fail.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li>Numerous changes to make engines more realistic. Read <a
	href="http://www.eechcentral.com/index.php/Engine_operations">here</a>
	to learn how the engines work now.
	<ul>
	  <li>Added modelling of gas turbine part of engine (and not
	    only power turbine, as it used to be)</li>
	  <li>Engine control system automaticly controls gas turbine
	        RPM in an effort to keep rotor RPM at 100%</li>
	  <li>Added abillity to control throttle and starters for engines,
	        including full startup procedure</li>
	  <li>Added option for starting mission with engines off</li>
	  <li>Modelling of APU added</li>
	  <li>Modelling of engine temperature added</li>
	  <li>Engine fire due to overtemperature now happens at random
	    time, probability depending on temperature.</li>
	  <li>Improved engine instruments to show engine information
	    which previously was not modelled.</li>
	  <li>Modelled sounds for turbines and APU to correspond with
	        RPM of turbines</li>
	  <li>Fuel consumption depends on engine RPM</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Slow speed flight model tweaks.  Should make slow speed
	handling easier and more realistic, particularly sideways flight.
	<li>Decreased effectivness of wheel brake</li>

      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.6.2W3:</h4>

      <ul class="style44">
        <li>Add custom warzones without changing the code and custom
        warzones are treated as official warzones (dynamic water,
        desert textures etc).
        <li>An in-game season option is activated for some maps that
        have two seasons: summer and winter (Alaska, Aleut, Georgia,
        other will follow). if you select winter it will snow instead
        of rain.
        Winter textures are denoted with  &quot;name-W.bmp&quot; or
        &quot;name-W.dds&quot;. Also desert textures now always have
        the syntax: &quot;name-D.bmp&quot; or &quot;name-D.dds&quot;.
        <li>A new option is added in eech.ini:
        &quot;extended_textures&quot;. This option increases the
        number of terrain textures frmo 5 to 25 to enhance the realism
        of the landscape (it kills repetition) but special texture
        packs are needed (not released yet).
        <li>Working cockpit dials and lamps for Havoc (and Hind) by Firebird.
        <li>Alt-L toggles the high LOD feature so that when you fly
        above cities and your fps drops you can try switching it off.
        <li>Ctrl-N adjust brightness level of the night vision, for
        more detail. There are 3 levels.
        <li>TSD colour map display is improved and does not have such
        a large framerate hit when in 25km scale.
        <li>More HUD colours are added by Maverick.
        <li>HUD size and colour config are saved in eech.ini per gunship.
        <li>Three formations are added: diamond, ragged left and
        ragged right added by Maverick. Note you need a new files
        <em>FORMS.DAT</em>, included in this setup file.
        <li>A keycard has been added to this setup created by MAPI
        <li>A GWUT configuration file  has been added: GWUT162B.csv
        made by KLiM. See <a
        href="http://www.simhq.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=30;t=004561">here</a>
        for a description.
      <p><strong>IMPORTANT: this version needs a different texture setup. You will have to re-install the texture addon packs!</strong></p>
      <p>Known BUG: the loadout of the Apache hellfires is incorrect. It is fixed when you use one of the WUT files. </p>
      </ul>

      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.6.2W2:</h4>
      <ul class="style47">
        <li>In multiplayer the WUT file information is sent from the
           host to the client, so there is no need anymore to have the
	   correct WUT when you want to join a game.
        <li>Standardized terrain bitmaps with mipmapping and linear
	   filtering between identical textures (reacts to graphics card
	   anisotropy setting). 
          Set in eech.ini: texture_colour=1, mipmapping=1, texture_filtering =1
        <li>Dynamic water textures give the impression of flowing
	  river, reservoir and sea (eech.ini: dynamic_water=1)
        <li>For texture modders, (untested) alpha blending support for dds textures
        <li>Autosave and Quicksave (Ctrl-Z), eech.ini setting
	  autosave=n (n= nr of minutes)
        <li>Three brightness levels of PNVS night vision, press Ctrl-N when in game.
        <li>Hardware sound support (4 speakers)
        <li>TrackIR vector support (eech.ini: TIR_6DOF=1
        <li>Use of 24bit textures is now default, no more tweaking
	your NVIDIA graphics card
        <li>Screenshots can now be taken when in 32bit mode
        <li>Numerous bug fixes and code cleaning
      </ul>

      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.6.1W5:</h4>
      <ul class="style44">
        <li>Texture colour mod, with special texture packs </li>
        <li>Wideview: pilot's head pitch is added </li>
        <li>HUD: scalable and background </li>
        <li> View range increased.</li>
        <li>6 Degrees of Freedom movement for TrackIR with Vector Expension</li>
        <li>Bug fixes: new trackir.dll,  radar intialization, cannon tracking, F3/F4 in apache 3D cockpit.</li>
        <li>Outside view zoom with mousewheel enabled.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.6.1W4:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Saitek X52 controller fix </li>
        <li>Apache havoc maps can be read without owning EEAH </li>
        <li>Texture mod: read custom textures from user defined directories</li>
        <li><span lang=EN-GB>Disappearing objects at high FOV fixed</span></li>
        <li>Reading wideview from eech.ini file fixed </li>

        <li>Make cockpit bar in apache cockpit disappear using wideview </li>
        <li>Cannon tracking boresight </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Fixes/features in 1.6.1W3:</h4>
      <ul class="style44">
        <li>NSIS installer that should help making the install process a bit easier
        <li>Fixed deadzones for controllers. All axis except collective  and FLIR zoom  now have a 1% deadzone to avoid &quot;drifting&quot;.
        <li>New mouselook handling. You can now specify if you want mouselook only  for internal or external view. You can cycle through &quot;off&quot;, &quot;internal&quot;, &quot;external&quot; and &quot;on&quot; by clicking on the &quot;Mouselook&quot; button in the controller options page. &quot;On&quot; means mouselook is active in both inside and outside views.
        <li>Analogue EO panning control in all helicopters, not only the comanche and the hokum. Zoom and ground stabilisation is NOT implemented.
        <li>EECH.INI option &quot;external_trackir&quot; <br>
    if TrackIR is active, let it control external view too
        <li>EECH.INI option &quot;high_lod_hack&quot; <br>
    EXPERIMENTAL! Enables highest level-of-detail models at far distances. Nice for higher FOVs, bad for FPS (esp. near cities)
        <li>A few other &quot;under the hood&quot; changes that you should not notice :p
        <li>Added new string file that enables localization of the new controller UI. This can be found in \common\data\language\TLATE6.DAT. Volunteers for german, french, spanish, italian translations are welcome. I am not sure how and if this will work with polish/russian translations. </li>
      </ul>
