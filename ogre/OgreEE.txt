OgreEE is a separate dynamic link library designed to map Enemy Engaged
functionality onto Ogre3D rendering engine.

You will need the following tools for build process
1. Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (Express Edition is enough)
2. OgreSDK vc9 1.9 http://www.ogre3d.org/download/sdk

In order to build OgreEE you need to make the following steps
1. OgreSDK
1.1. Install it somewhere (for example, at D:\)
1.2. Set Environment variable OGRE_SDK to the corresponding directory
(for example, "D:\OgreSDK_vc9_v1-9-0", no quotes)

2. Build OgreEE with Visual Studio

3. Optionally build cube with Visual Studio. Both src/ogre_int.hpp and
cube/options.hpp have tunable options.

4. Build EE supplying "ogre=1" to wmake.
Addition of ogre_debug=1 will link the project with debug version of
OgreEE and Ogre3D.

5. Use run.bat to create EE-compatible Ogre environment and run EE.
